# Math Calculator
This application allows a user to calculate a wide variety of things ranging from area of a sphere to distance traveled of a projectile.

## Examples

### Area of a cube
Let's select option 1 when we run the program. It's called Shapes.

From there, we will be prompted to select a shape from the menu:

What is the shape?
Cylinder: 1
Cube: 2
Sphere: 3

Type the number 2 and we are given a choice to pick between area or volume. For this example, let's go with area. After choosing the units of measurement, we give a number for length and we will see our answer!
