# Math Calculator
This application allows a user to calculate a wide variety of things ranging from area of a sphere to distance traveled of a projectile.

## Examples

### Area of a cube
If we do not wish to add an image to our slide, we can simply click the button labeled Create Slide once we have our desired text and it will be generated!

### Tension in a string or rope
We run the program and see the first window (MainWindow) pop up.

### Calculate Distance of a projectile
If we want something different from what's inside the title and main section, or want something more specific for our slide, we can write in the boldSearchTextBox
